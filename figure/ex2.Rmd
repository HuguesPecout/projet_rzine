## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r chunk1, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
result <- 1 + 7
print(result)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=10}
plot(x = c(1,3,7,4,6), y = c(6,2,1,3,8), 
     pch = 20, cex = 3, col= "red",
     xlab = "X", ylab = "Y")    
```
